I'll try to list here any assets that are not my own.

Code:
I've tried to avoid using other people's code, the only cases where I did use any directly were editor tools to make my life easier

SceneAutoLoader.cs -> http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SceneAutoLoader
PlayerPrefsEditor -> https://github.com/sabresaurus/PlayerPrefsEditor

Plugins:
TextMeshPro -> https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/textmesh-pro-84126

Art:
I don't know how to draw. At all. I did want some nice art assets to liven up the game, so I used some that came with an appropriate license.

Generic UI art -> https://opengameart.org/content/ui-pack (Credits to Kenney)
Free RPG Icons -> https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/free-rpg-icons-111659
Game Icons -> https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/game-icons-91138

If I used any assets that aren't listed here, it's likely because I forgot. Sorry.
