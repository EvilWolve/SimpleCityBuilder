Hello, fellow game developer!

I followed the specifications as closely as I could, I hope I didn't stray too far from them. I may have got a little carried away...

To place buildings, drag and drop buildings from the building menu. If you want to start from scratch, open the settings menu and reset the game.

I left a file named "Design Decisions" where I tried to keep track of what I was thinking about specific code design decisions, or how I interpreted the specs.
Another file, "Acknowledgments", tracks all assets that I did not create myself.

I only own a Windows machine, so I'm not sure how well this will run on Mac. Let me know if there are any issues, I may be able to help troubleshoot.

I had one annoying bug from TextMesh Pro during development where all the text shaders stopped working. If that should happen, either reimporting the shaders within Unity or re-downloading them should fix it.

Anyway, this has been fun, but I think I'm done (for now) :-)

Best regards,
Wolf
